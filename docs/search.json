    "text": "Objective and Motivation\nThe goal of this research projectis to analyze the impact of unconditional government stipends on the U.S. economy, such as stimulus checks. To identify these effects I will analyze the effects of the stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits issued by the US government in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis is an important topic as inequality rises direct government action may become increasingly necessary. Increased taxation on the rich and targeted government programs can only do so much to help those at the lower and middle ends of income. Especially as the groups in need of help become larger and their needs more diverse, the high administrative costs of judging who gets the benefits and what they are applicable to may become untenable. In this case, regular stimulus payments or higher unemployment benefits may become necessary to the continued economic health of the country. However, without knowing the effects of these methods, it is difficult to say whether or not they would do more harm than good."
